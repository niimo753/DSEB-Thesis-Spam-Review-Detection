# Fundamental Face Recognition Models
A fundamental Face Recognition System using two elementary techniques: PCA, which is short for Principal Components Analysis, as the features extractor and Distance Based Model with varying distance metrics, such as euclidean, manhattan, mahalanobis...(according to "Distance measures for PCA-based face recognition" paper) as the classifier.

# Dataset
The dataset belongs to the AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. It contains 400 images with size 112 x 92 of 40 individuals, each individual has 10 images. For some indivisuals, their images were captured at different times, introducing variations in lighting, facial expressions (such as open or closed eyes, and smiling or not smiling), and facial details (such as wearing glasses or not). All images were taken against a dark, uniform background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position, allowing for slight side movements.
